# DDoS Incident Response Analysis Using NIST CSF  
*Multimedia Company Security Assessment | June 2025*

## Project Overview  
This analysis documents a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack against a multimedia company providing web design and marketing services. The incident caused a **2-hour network outage** due to an ICMP flood exploiting an unconfigured firewall. Following NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) guidelines, this report outlines remediation strategies and security improvements.

## Incident Summary  
- **Attack Vector:** ICMP packet flood via unconfigured firewall  
- **Impact:** Complete internal network disruption (2 hours)  
- **Response Actions:**  
  - Blocked incoming ICMP traffic  
  - Shut down non-critical services  
  - Restored critical systems  
- **Post-Incident Controls:**  
  - Firewall rules limiting ICMP packet rate  
  - Source IP verification for anti-spoofing  
  - Network monitoring software deployment  
  - IDS/IPS implementation

## NIST CSF Analysis  

### üîç Identify  
*System vulnerabilities and risk assessment*  
- **Misconfigured firewall** allowing unrestricted ICMP traffic  
- Lack of recent firewall rule audits  
- Absence of network traffic baselines for anomaly detection  
- **Critical Gap:** No asset inventory mapping network dependencies

### üõ°Ô∏è Protect  
*Security controls implementation*  
**Implemented:**  
- ICMP rate limiting via firewall rules  
- Source IP verification to prevent IP spoofing  
**Planned Improvements:**  
- Mandatory staff training on secure configuration  
- Comprehensive network documentation  
- Role-based access controls for network devices

### üì° Detect  
*Monitoring and anomaly identification*  
**Implemented:**  
- Real-time traffic analysis software  
- IDS/IPS filtering suspicious ICMP patterns  
**Planned Improvements:**  
- Automated alerts for ICMP traffic spikes  
- Baseline establishment for "normal" network behavior  
- Centralized logging with SIEM integration 

### ‚ö° Respond  
*Incident containment procedures*  
**Actions Taken:**  
- Immediate ICMP traffic blocking  
- Deactivation of non-essential services  
- Prioritized restoration of critical systems  
**Improvement Plan:**  
- Formal incident response playbook  
- Quarterly incident simulation drills  
- Stakeholder communication protocol

### üîÑ Recover  
*System restoration and hardening*  
**Completed:**  
- Full service restoration post-mitigation  
- Vulnerability remediation verification  
**Future Objectives:**  
- Regular backup/recovery plan testing  
- Post-incident review documentation  
- Cyber insurance evaluation

## Key Recommendations  
1. **Firewall Hardening:** Implement default-deny rules with explicit allow lists  
2. **Continuous Monitoring:** Deploy 24/7 network traffic analysis with AI anomaly detection  
3. **Response Automation:** Develop runbooks for automated DDoS mitigation  
4. **Third-Party Testing:** Conduct biannual penetration tests and DDoS simulations[8][11]
